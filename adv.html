    <h1> The Future of Advertising Education</h1>

    <div data-aos="slide-up">
    <img src="ADVimg/advcircles.png" alt="ADV circles">
    <h3>The Challenge</h3>
    <p>The Department of Advertising at UIUC enlisted our help to research the experience of graduate advertising students. 
      Our goal was to suggest ways to improve and future proof the advertising graduate experience. </p>
    <p><span>How can we reimagine and strengthen the future of advertising education?</span></p>
  </div>

  <div data-aos="slide-up">
      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>Timeframe: September 2020 - December 2020</p>
      <p>My Role: Design Strategist/Researcher </p>
      <p>Team Member: Ted Faust - Post Doctoral Research Fellow</p>
  </div>

  <div data-aos="slide-up">
    <h3>Secondary Research</h3>
      <p>We conducted research on competing schools to see what their advertising programs offered.
         Many competitors did not offer online programs, but also offered more specialization tracks than UIUC. </p>

    </div>

    <div data-aos="slide-up">
    <h3>Interviews</h3>
      <p>We recruited 6 industry professionals and 9 advertising students/alumni to interview. 
        Before we conducted interviews we created interview guides that asked questions such as: </p>
      <ol>
        <li>What is the industry looking for in advertising graduates? </li>
        <li>What type of classes benefited you the most in your career?</li>
        <li>What are your wants and wishes when it comes to advertising curriculum? </li>
      </ol>
    </div>
    
    
    <div data-aos="slide-up">
    <h3>Synthesis</h3>
      
      <p>After each interview we used Miro to write down key quotes and insights from interviews.</p>
      <img src="ADVimg/advdownload.png" alt="post it note download" width="50%">

      <p>Next, we grouped together similar quotes from different interviews to find themes.
        This early synthesis paved the path for us to create frameworks to convey the findings. </p>

    </div>

    <div data-aos="slide-up">
    <h3>Persona Development</h3> 
        <p>We created 6 different personas to capture the motivations and needs of students we interviewed.  </p>
          <img src = "ADVimg/advpersonas.png" alt="personas" width="50%"> 

        <p>Each persona falls into a certain type of advertising degree offered by the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. </p>
        <img src="ADVimg/advcircles.png" alt="Types of adv degress" width="50%">

        <p>We also placed each persona on a 2x2 to show their motivations and desired level of commitment.</p>

    </div>

    <div data-aos="slide-up">
    <h3>Industry Insights</h3>
        <p>Speaking to industry professionals helped us understand how the industry hires and what they look for in candidates. </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Tech trends, legal shifts and certificate training are <span>reshaping</span> the industry</li>
          <li>Advertising curriculum <span>should not be based off of industry trends</span> since the future cannot be predicted. 
            Instead, curriculum should be focused on teaching students to adapt and strategize</li>
          <li>The industry is constantly changing, but <span>certain skillsets</span> will always be needed</li>
          <li>The industry is more interested in hiring <span>collaborative specialists</span> instead of generalists</li>
  
        </ol>
      </div>


      <div data-aos="slide-up">
    <h3>Design Opportunity Spaces</h3>
        <p>Using the information we synthesized from interviews, we came up with 
          5 opportunity spaces where the experience could be redesigned. </p>
        <p><span>Leveraging UIUC</span></p>
        <p>How might we leverage UIUC's unique assets, to offer value propositions that differentiate from competitors?</p>

        <p><span>Specialization</span></p>
        <p>How might we design pathways to help students pursue distinct tracks?</p>

        <p><span>Student Collaboration</span></p>
        <p>How might we design a more coherent and productive collaborative experience?</p>

        <p><span>Professional Development</span></p>
        <p>How might we leverage or expand peer relationships and campus resources for mentorship + networking?</p>

        <p><span>"Real World" Clients</span></p>
        <p>How might we create more learning experiences that connect them with “real world” clientele?</p>
      </div>

    <div data-aos="slide-up">
    <h3>Impact</h3>
    <p>We presented our findings to the head of the advertising program and received positive feedback. 
      We are currently waiting on next steps.</p>
