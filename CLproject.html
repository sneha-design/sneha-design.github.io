<h2>DFA National Intern - Usability Testing</h2>

<figcaption>Summer 2019 DFA Interns</figcaption> 

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>This past summer I interned at Design for America's National Office in Evanston. One of the projects 
I worked on was conducting usability tests to iterate the Challenge Library Interface. 
DFA's Challenge Library is a Google Doc that holds various projects for DFA studios across the nation to use. </p>

<h3>Overview</h3> 
<p>Timeframe: June 2019-August 2019</p> 
<p>My Role: User Researcher</p> 
<p>- Conducted usability tests</p> 
<p>- Scoped challenges and built relationships with stakeholders in the Chicago area</p> 
<p>- Wrote content for the Challenge Library</p> 


<p>Methods: Between-subjects tests, think aloud method, wireframes, paper prototypes, and feedback sessions</p> 

<br> 

<h3>Before Starting Usability Testing</h3> 
<p>Before the starting the first round of usability tests I put together a 
script and tasks for the user to go through to ensure consistency. 
My main goal was to see if users understood the given challenge and knew how to take the next steps to 
start working on the challenge.</p> 
<br> 

<h3>Major Pain Points</h3> 
	<ol>
		<li><span>Lack of guidance</span> on how to start using the CL which caused many users to feel confused</li> 
		<li><span>Too much text</span> caused the users to feel overwhelmed and less willing to use the Challenge Library</li> 
		<li>Challenges are <span>not always relevant</span> to a user's specific location</li> 	
	</ol>

<h3>Paper Prototype</h3> 
<p>Since I now had an idea of some changes I would like to make I decided to create a paper prototype. 
I printed out a challenge and cut it out to quickly rearrange the information and add sketches. 
This allowed me to really see what I wanted to change before making changes digitally. 
Using this method also made it easy for my boss to annotate my decisions and offer feedback. </p>

<h3>Round 2 of User Testing</h3> 
<p>For this round of testing I decided to use the <span>between-subjects method</span> so I could <span>check if there was a clear improvement between the old and iterated interface.</span>
The new interface was deemed less overwhelming, but was still seen as confusing due to the content and structure. </p>

<h3>Wireframe</h3>
<p>Recognizing the patterns allowed me to create a wireframe that could be translated to any challenge in the library. 
I sketched out multiple wireframes 
and then organized feedback sessions with the DFA Fellows in order to decide on which one worked best.</p> 
<p>Changes I incorporated</p> 
<ol>
	<li>adding storyboards to better capture the experience of the user at the center of the challenge</li>
	<li>writing brand new content geared towards students for the climate change challenges </li>
	<li>adding in similar successful past projects that other studios did </li>
	<li>restructuring content and making headers more personable</li>
	<li>incorporating steps from DFA's process guide in order to create actionable steps for studios to take </li>
	<li>Changing the font and colors to be easier to read </li>
</ol>

<h3>Iteration of the Challenge Library</h3> 
<p>After all of the usability tests and feedback sessions I recreated the Google Doc interface. 
Users reported feeling that the new interface was welcoming and offered more guidance.</p>

<p>Here is the brand new "next steps" portion which is personalized to each challenge and 
gives students a solid starting point.</p>

<h3>Reflection</h3> 
<p>Working on this project taught me how <span>it is important to not jump to assumptions about your audience</span>, 
even when you might be part of it. As a DFA member myself I had to put 
aside my own feelings and instead listen to the findings from usability tests and feedback.</p>
